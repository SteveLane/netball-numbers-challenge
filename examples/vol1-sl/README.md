# Summary

I was trying to see if there was any pattern in season-end percentage
over seasons in the ANZC and SSN in this figure. E.g. do we see any
domination appearing? Slow deterioration of teams?

In the figure I’ve highlighted the Vixens, my team, and the Fever due to
their general strength recently. I think the figure nicely highlights
the growth in the Fever’s percentage: from the down the bottom in the
early days, to up the top recently. The Vixens: a little bit the other
way around.

I’m not entirely happy with the figure (I’m a statistician, not a
visualisation expert); I’m not sure on including the axes, and also how
the demarcation between ANZC and SSN is displayed.

If you want to see how I’ve done this, see [the
walkthrough](walkthrough.md).
